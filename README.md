### Hi there! 👋

I am Thomas Brouwer, programmer, game designer, and founder of Fifth Quarter Studios.

I'm currently working on a number of projects:
- 🏢 Voxel City: A platform for a voxel-based city where users can live and manage their own plots. 
- 🤺 'Zes': A couch-PvP/party game that is set in an ever-shrinking hexagonal arena.
- 🏎️ 'Zamona': A game where players can race on a self-made track, just like those old Carrera racetrack toys.
- 🚇 The Hyperloop Experience: A group-project, commisioned by a client, which displays the workings of a Hyperloop in VR.
- ...
- More to come!

If you have any ideas, or want to chat for any reason, hit me up on Discord: Ikke#6585. Or join the Fifth Quarter's Discord: https://discord.gg/unPAfxuaEY.
